> Quick Update 1: Since the lectures are getting more domain specific and complex, it is becoming tedious to note down everything right during the lecture, so I usually revisit and make the necessary changes or corrections (missed slides or comments) after the talk. I will try to upload the notes within a day or two but if for some reason I cannot, I will make sure that I upload the entire week's notes by the weekend.
